    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "KNN, SVM, and AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN algorithms are simple to understand and implement. They have a strength in that not much real training time is required, so they perform well in situations where training time is a factor; however, the tradeoff is that prediction requires a lengthy search through the data, so they may be too slow in situations where predictions happen frequently and when there is a large amount of data. This model is a good candidate for the income-prediction problem since we only need to make a prediction once. You might find KNNs in applications where there are few constraints on memory usage, since the KNN model requires a lot of memory to store the data points. You might find KNNs in applications where map proximity is a factor, such as dispatching applications (for example, you might use a KNN in an Uber-like app that chooses a specific taxicab driver and directs him or her to a pickup location).\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM algorithms are more complex, and the classifiers that they find are harder to understand. If the data is linearly separable, they will find a classifier that maximizes the margin between the classes, so they have the strength of being fairly resistant to overfitting. If there is significant overlap between the labelled classes in the training data, however, SVM algorithms may not be able to find a good solution. The usual way to solve this problem is to apply the kernel trick, but there may be cases where a kernel that separates the data can't be found, like if the data is very noisy. Although the data in the case of finding donors might have some overlap in many features, I suspect that there are at least one or two feature dimensions (for example, capital gains) which will differentiate the low-income people from the high-income people. Therefore SVM algorithms seem like a decent choice here. Since SVMs are quick at making predictions, I would guess they could be found in applications where classification time is a factor, such as realtime interactive applications that contain an element of gesture recognition, such as certain Nintendo Wii games.\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost algorithms are ensemble methods designed to work with other classifiers, where the other classifier is treated as a base learner which the AdaBoost algorithm applies over and over again to find a better and better fit. They should only be applied to weak learners, i.e. classifiers that always perform better than random chance at correctly labelling the data—-but if this constraint is satisfied they have the strength that they will improve upon that classifier. AdaBoost is resistant to overfitting except in cases where the base learner is a very strong learner that is also very susceptible to overfitting. I think AdaBoost, in conjunction with some other algorithm, would be a good thing to try on this data. One might find AdaBoost algorithms in almost any application where other machine learning algorithms are used; however, in terms of training time, they will always take longer than the underlying algorithm they are paired with. So in cases where fast training is required they may not be needed."

    "**Answer: ** According to the evaluation I performed earlier, I would prefer to use the AdaBoost algorithm, using a base learner DecisionTreeClassifier (which is the sklearn AdaBoost default base learner), for identifying the individuals who make more then $50,000 dollars. This combination had the fastest training and prediction time, and it had the best accuracy and f-score across the test data, suggesting it would perform the best at predicting the income class of any future potential donors. The AdaBoost algorithm suits this data since we have a relatively straightforward classification problem; plus, the AdaBoost algorithm would suit any data set that could be handled by other machine learning algorithms, since the AdaBoost simply iterates upon the training of some other algorithm. Of course, if we had to use a base learner algorithm that takes a lot of training time (such as the SVM algorithm shown above), then the AdaBoost algorithm would train even slower. But we shouldn't need to do that very often as very weak (and fast) classifiers perform well under AdaBoost."

    "**Answer: ** First, let me describe the DecisionTreeClassifier (DTC). In this case, the DTC is looking at a bunch of data that is divided into rows (where each row is a person) and columns (where each column is a data \"feature\" such as the person's education level). The DTC works by going through, picking a column, and putting a divider into the column  that splits the people into two groups: those who the DTC thinks has more than 50k, and those who it thinks has less. The first time it does this, it will get a bunch wrong, but since we are feeding it training data where we already know how much everyone makes, it can grade its own performance by simply counting up the number of people that were mislabelled. Then the DTC will go through the dividing process again and again, diving the original set into smaller and smaller groups of people, and labelling each group as belonging to the under-50k group or the over-50k group. By the end, we hope that the DTC isn't labelling very many people incorrectly. But there will still probably be some incorrect labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "So next, we feed the DTC into an AdaBoost model. The AdaBoost will run the DCT repeatedly, causing the DTC to start from scratch each time; BUT each time it runs it, it will tune the DTC so that it cares more about correctly labelling the people that it got wrong in the previous round. So each time, the DTC will divide the groups in subtly different ways, but by the end it will be doing better at labelling the people that it initially had the most trouble in labelling. "

I already tried performing a grid search on various AdaBoost parameters and found the difference between the optimized and unoptimized scores were pretty small, only like 1 percent better. And for runtime reasons it doesn't make sense to run a GridSearch with too many parameters, so I don't include those AdaBoost parameters here. But when I tune the base learner parameters the level of improvement is much more. This suggests that I might have been smarter if I had run the grid search to find good base learner parameters *first* before applying the AdaBoost algorithm to the base learner.\n",

The presence of features like capital gains or losses  probably indicate a high income, but I feel that the vast majority have no capital gains or losses so there is not much information gained by categorizing the ones that do (this is why I put capital gains at the bottom). But there is greater variation among the populace with regard to education level, age, race, and hours worked per week, so I feel that there is a lot of information to be gained by differentiating along these axes. Education level comes first in my opinion (since I know that greater education levels often result in better jobs), followed by age (more experienced workers tend to be paid more), race (there are known discrepancies in employment between races), and then hours worked per week."

    "**Answer:** I was not that close in my answer from question 6. My reasoning was clearly wrong with regard to the importance of capital losses or gains, as it seems that these both provide enough information gain, and enough people in the data set have capital gains and losses, that these are very important features to discriminate on. Age was, as I suspected, a very relevant feature, as was hours-per-week. I am a little bit surprised that the education number is here in the top 5, but the education level is not. My impression was that academic degrees provided a significant boost to employment, but these results suggest that just spending the time in school, even if there is no ultimate graduation from a degree, provides more benefit."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
